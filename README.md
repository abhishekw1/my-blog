# Angular and Scully

Angular is a robust JavaScript framework that we can use to build excellent and performant web applications. It provides a complete set of tools and libraries to create dynamic, single-page applications with great user experiences. However, traditional Angular applications can sometimes struggle with SEO and initial page load times, which are critical for content-heavy sites like blogs.

This is where **Scully** comes into play.

## What is Scully?

Scully is a static site generator specifically built for Angular. It transforms your Angular application into a **Jamstack** site by pre-rendering pages at build time and serving static HTML content. This approach significantly improves performance, SEO, and the overall user experience. With Scully, you can build Angular applications that are optimized for search engines and load quickly, making it ideal for blogs, documentation sites, and other content-rich platforms.

### Benefits of Using Scully with Angular

1. **SEO Optimization:** Pre-rendered HTML pages allow search engines to crawl and index content effectively.
2. **Improved Performance:** Static content reduces server load and speeds up page load times.
3. **Enhanced Security:** Static sites eliminate the need for a backend, minimizing security vulnerabilities.
4. **Easy Deployment:** Scully-generated sites can be hosted on platforms like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static file server.

## Conclusion
By combining the power of Angular and Scully, you can build fast, SEO-friendly static websites with all the flexibility and features of a modern JavaScript framework. Scully extends Angular's capabilities to support the Jamstack architecture, making it a perfect choice for building blogs, marketing sites, and other content-driven applications.
