# Building Reusable Components in Angular

Creating reusable components is essential for building maintainable and scalable applications. Angular's component architecture allows us to design independent and modular UI elements that can be reused across different parts of the application.

In this post, we discussed best practices for building reusable components and showcased how to pass data using `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators.

## Conclusion
By adhering to these best practices, you can create reusable and modular components that simplify your codebase and reduce development time. Reusable components are the building blocks of a well-architected Angular application and enable teams to work more collaboratively and efficiently.
