# Getting Started with Angular Forms

Handling user input is one of the core functionalities of any web application. Angular provides two ways to build forms: **Template-Driven Forms** and **Reactive Forms**.

In this post, weâ€™ve discussed when to use each approach and provided practical examples to help you implement forms in your Angular applications.

## Conclusion
Choosing the right form-building strategy depends on the complexity of your application. Template-Driven Forms are ideal for simpler use cases, while Reactive Forms are more powerful for complex scenarios. By understanding both, you can select the best method for each project and create robust forms with ease.
