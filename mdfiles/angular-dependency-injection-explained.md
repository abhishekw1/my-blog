# Angular Dependency Injection Explained

Dependency injection (DI) is a core feature of Angular that allows for efficient management of components and services. It enables us to build loosely coupled code and make our applications more modular and testable.

In this post, we’ve explored how DI works in Angular and provided a step-by-step guide to configuring providers and injectors.

## Conclusion
Understanding dependency injection is crucial for building scalable applications in Angular. By using DI, you can manage service lifecycles, create testable components, and maintain a clean architecture. With this foundation, you’re well-equipped to build maintainable and robust Angular applications.
