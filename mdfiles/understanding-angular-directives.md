# Understanding Angular Directives

Angular directives are a powerful way to manipulate the DOM and create dynamic user experiences. They extend the standard HTML syntax to provide additional functionality, making it easier to build complex components and UIs.

In this post, we'll explore the three main types of Angular directives: **Component Directives**, **Structural Directives**, and **Attribute Directives**.

## Conclusion
Mastering Angular directives is essential for any developer looking to create versatile and responsive web applications. By leveraging directives effectively, you can control the structure and behavior of your app with minimal code.
